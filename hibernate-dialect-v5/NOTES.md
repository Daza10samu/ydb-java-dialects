#### 1. ORDER BY ? 

The ORDER BY clause generates SQL that uses the original
column names of the table, instead of the 
aliases that were previously specified.
At the moment, this is an incorrect YDB request.

```sql
select 
    student0_.studentId as studenti1_1_, 
    student0_.groupId as groupid2_1_, 
    student0_.name as name3_1_ 
from Students student0_ order by student0_.name_
```

At the moment, our solution to this problem is 
to use native SQL for queries or upgrade to Hibernate 6.

#### 2. ESCAPE ? GENERATED BY Spring Data JPA

The Spring Data JPA framework generates the `LAKE ? ESCAPE ?` clause 
when the repository method signature contains the substring `ByFieldContains`.
At the moment, this is an incorrect YDB request. ESCAPE don't have param.

Here is an example solution to problems 1 and 2 using native SQL:

```kotlin
@Query(
        "SELECT * FROM books WHERE books.title LIKE %:title% ORDER BY books.publication_date",
        nativeQuery = true
)
fun findBooksByTitleContainsOrderByPublicationDate(title: String, pageable: Pageable): Slice<Book>
```
